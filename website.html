            <h2>My Interests</h2>
            <p>Sports! As a chicago native, SPORTS(!) play a large part of my life. It's not uncommon for people to refer to me as the number one fan of the Chicago Blackhawks. People sometimes say I talk to much about too much, but I disagree.</p>

            <p> as it turns out... Even posting that picture is a problem. So i had to delete it. I'm not sure why the person i met with is so secretive.. its like he's in hiding or something.. I don't get it, this was all the way back in 2022.</p>
	    <p> Regardless, the location is beautiful.. I'd sure love to stay in one of these nearby resorts. The person I met seems like he practically lived in one lately it seems.. he says the statue on the property reminds him on he felt about the market... whatever that means.</p>

            <h2>My Favorite Car!</h2>
	    <p>An iconic example of human engineering... The Pontiac Aztek. There has never been a more attractive car ever made. My opinion won't change, so don't even try.</p>
